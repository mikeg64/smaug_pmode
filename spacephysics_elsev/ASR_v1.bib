	Examples include Graphics Processing Units (GPU's) and Cell. They
	have potentially large gains in performance, at modest power and
	monetary cost. We implemented a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation
	code on a variety of heterogeneous and multi-core architectures ---
	multi-core x86, Cell, Nvidia and ATI GPU --- in different languages,
	FORTRAN, C, Cell, CUDA and OpenCL. We present initial performance
	results for these systems. To our knowledge, this is the widest comparison
	of heterogeneous systems for MHD simulations. We review the different
	challenges faced in each architecture, and potential bottlenecks.
	We conclude that substantial gains in performance over traditional
	systems are possible, and in particular that is possible to extract
	a greater percentage of peak theoretical performance from some systems
	when compared to x86 architectures.},
